# Downloading the GrIMP mask and BedMachine

ArcticDEM and REMA strips are available as cloud-optimised GeoTIFFs (CoGs) on Amazon Web Services, so we can download them on the fly. The same is not true, however, for NSIDC data products. This includes the GrIMP mask and BedMachine, both used to provide optional masks/geoids when loading the strips. Instead, the user must provide a local directory containing the GrIMP mask tiles, and a direct filepath to the BedMachine data. 

These can be downloaded by running the `download_*.py` python scripts contained in this directory, which has been automatically generated by the NSIDC. Your Earthdata username/password must be provided, and the tiles will be downloaded into the current directory.
